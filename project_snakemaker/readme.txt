Using snakemake workflow to run this r code

Write a simple Cromwell workflow for r code


# install snakemaker.
cd C:\Users\chenj\Desktop\Jun\jchen\project_snakemaker


conda create -n snakemake-env python=3.11.5
# environment location: D:\software\anaconda4\envs\snakemake-env
conda activate snakemake-env
conda install -c conda-forge snakemake


# here using mamba to install snakemaker. and create the environment in their website.
conda activate snakemake
conda info --envs







To create a Snakemake workflow for running an R script, you'll need to set up a Snakefile and define the necessary rules to run your R script. Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:

Directory Structure
Let's assume you have the following directory structure:

kotlin
Copy code
my-workflow/
├── Snakefile
├── scripts/
│   └── analysis.R
└── results/
    └── output.txt (this will be generated)
Snakefile
Create a Snakefile in the my-workflow/ directory:

python
Copy code
rule all:
    input:
        "results/output.txt"

rule run_r_script:
    input:
        "scripts/analysis.R"
    output:
        "results/output.txt"
    shell:
        "Rscript {input} > {output}"
scripts/analysis.R
Ensure your R script (analysis.R) writes output to a file named output.txt. Here's a simple example of what analysis.R could look like:

r
Copy code
# analysis.R

# Sample R code
result <- summary(cars)

# Write the result to a file
write.table(result, file = "results/output.txt", sep = "\t", col.names = NA)
Running the Workflow
To run the Snakemake workflow, navigate to the my-workflow directory and execute the following command:

sh
Copy code
snakemake --cores 1
Explanation
Rule all:

Specifies the final target of the workflow (results/output.txt).
Rule run_r_script:

Takes the R script (scripts/analysis.R) as input.
Specifies the output file (results/output.txt).
Runs the R script using Rscript, redirecting its output to the specified output file.




Using Docker
To use Docker, add the container directive to the run_r_script rule:

python
Copy code
rule run_r_script:
    input:
        "scripts/analysis.R"
    output:
        "results/output.txt"
    container:
        "rocker/r-base:latest"
    shell:
        "Rscript {input} > {output}"
Using Conda
To use Conda, create an environment file (e.g., envs/r_env.yml):

yaml
Copy code
name: r_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - r-base
Then, modify the run_r_script rule to use this Conda environment:

python
Copy code
rule run_r_script:
    input:
        "scripts/analysis.R"
    output:
        "results/output.txt"
    conda:
        "envs/r_env.yml"
    shell:
        "Rscript {input} > {output}"
Run the workflow with Conda integration using:

sh
Copy code
snakemake --use-conda --cores 1
